You need node v16.x.x for this. My advice is to install [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). It's a node version manager that will let you switch the node version your terminal is using.

Install the Prettier VS Code extension, ID `esbenp.prettier-vscode`.

Go into settings and turn on `Format on Save`.
You may want to play around with `Auto Save` as well. (I like onFocusChange)
